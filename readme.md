# First Golang Project

To run the project
`git clone git@github.com:nanichang/bookstore.git`

`cd` into `cmd/main` dir

Run build the project by running `go build`

Finally, to start to go server, run `go run main.go`

NOTE: Make sure to have previously created a database called `bookstore`

HAPPY TESTING
